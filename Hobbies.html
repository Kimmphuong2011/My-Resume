    <li>The Leader has no title</li>
    <p>Thi is a motivational book that challenges conventional notions of leadership. Through the story of a character named Blake, Sharma illustrates that anyone can be a leader, regardless of their title. The book inspires me to embrace a leadership mindset, offering practical insights for personal development and purposeful living.</p>
    <p>Currently stitching to this book. I would highly recommend this book to you all.</p>
